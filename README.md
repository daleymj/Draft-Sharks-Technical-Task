I put all the files in one directory for ease of use just for this project. Normally I would create a more specific file structure.

I put all the javascript in the one file since it is a single page task. Normally I would break down the code(componentization) for best practices and scalability and organization.

I only used a few teams just to create the functionality and code it faster.

I wrote up a .scss file and converted it to .css for the browser

I used flex-box to make it responsive and beautiful across all devices.

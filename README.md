    <h1>Draft Sharks Technical Task</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates a responsive, mobile-friendly depth chart page for Draft Sharks, built to showcase core skills in front-end development and Vue.js. The assignment was completed within the 2-3 hour recommended time frame, focusing on essential functionality, Vue usage, and basic accessibility.</p>

    <h3>Features Implemented</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Created a fully responsive layout using CSS Flexbox, adapting seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Vue.js for Interactivity:</strong> Used Vue.js via CDN to handle state management and interactivity. Implemented essential functionality, including position filtering, offense vs. defense toggling, and independent sorting for each section.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Added a dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Accessibility:</strong> Implemented semantic HTML for basic accessibility, including the use of descriptive tags and straightforward keyboard navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover Effects:</strong> Added hover effects to improve user experience. Filtering options change color on hover, providing visual feedback, and dropdown lists include hover styling for better accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective Team Display for Demonstration:</strong> For the purpose of this project, only a few teams were included to demonstrate functionality and interactivity quickly. With more time, this could be expanded to include a full set of teams.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Additional Enhancements (Given More Time)</h3>
    <p>With more time, I would implement the following enhancements to improve scalability, accessibility, and user experience:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Componentization in Vue:</strong> Breaking down the application into reusable components (e.g., <code>TeamSelector</code>, <code>Filters</code>, and <code>PlayerList</code>) would improve code organization and make future updates easier to manage.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility:</strong> I would further optimize accessibility by adding <code>aria</code> labels, roles, and focus states to enhance screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation. These updates would improve the experience for all users and reinforce inclusive design.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Design Techniques:</strong> Incorporating CSS Grid alongside Flexbox for larger screens could allow for a more refined layout, especially with complex data sections. Using responsive font scaling (<code>clamp()</code> or viewport units) would further enhance the visual design.</li>
        <li><strong>Expanded Interactivity:</strong> Building on the existing hover effects, I would add additional visual cues for player cards and filter sections, such as animations or tooltips for more detailed player stats.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>File Structure</h3>
    <p>To complete the assignment quickly, all files are in a single directory. In a full-scale project, I would implement a more organized structure for improved clarity and ease of maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vue.js</strong> (via CDN): for state management and interactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain CSS:</strong> for responsive layout, including Flexbox, with compiled SCSS for enhanced maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> to support basic accessibility requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installation & Usage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository.</li>
        <li>Open <code>dsTechTask.html</code> in your browser to view the project.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This project illustrates a solid foundation in responsive design and Vue.js within a limited time frame, meeting core functional requirements. The additional enhancements mentioned highlight my knowledge of scalable, user-centered front-end development and demonstrate how I would improve the application with additional time.</p>

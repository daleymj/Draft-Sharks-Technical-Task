# Draft Sharks Technical Task

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a responsive, mobile-friendly depth chart page for Draft Sharks, built to showcase core skills in front-end development and Vue.js. The assignment was completed within the 2-3 hour time limit, focusing on essential functionality, Vue usage, and basic accessibility.

### Features Implemented

1. **Responsive Design**: 
   - Created a fully responsive layout using CSS Flexbox, adapting seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
   
2. **Vue.js for Interactivity**:
   - Used Vue.js via CDN to handle state management and interactivity.
   - Implemented essential functionality, including position filtering, offense vs. defense toggling, and independent sorting for each section.

3. **Dark Mode**:
   - Added a dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.

4. **Basic Accessibility**:
   - Implemented semantic HTML for basic accessibility, including the use of descriptive tags and straightforward keyboard navigation.

5. **Hover Effects**:
   - Added hover effects to improve user experience. Filtering options change color on hover, providing visual feedback, and dropdown lists include hover styling for better accessibility.

6. **Selective Team Display for Demonstration**:
   - For the purpose of this project, only a few teams were included to demonstrate functionality and interactivity quickly. With more time, this could be expanded to include the full set of teams.

### Additional Enhancements (Given More Time)

With more time, I would implement the following enhancements to improve scalability, accessibility, and user experience:

1. **Componentization in Vue**:
   - Breaking down the application into reusable components (e.g., `TeamSelector`, `Filters`, and `PlayerList`) would improve code organization and make future updates easier to manage.

2. **Enhanced Accessibility**:
   - I would further optimize accessibility by adding `aria` labels, roles, and focus states to enhance screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
   - These updates would improve the experience for all users and reinforce inclusive design.

3. **Advanced Design Techniques**:
   - Incorporating CSS Grid alongside Flexbox for larger screens could allow for a more refined layout, especially with complex data sections.
   - Using responsive font scaling (`clamp()` or viewport units) would further enhance the visual design.

4. **Expanded Interactivity**:
   - Building on the existing hover effects, I would add additional visual cues for player cards and filter sections, such as animations or tooltips for more detailed player stats.

### File Structure

To complete the assignment quickly, all files are in a single directory. In a full-scale project, I would implement a more organized structure for improved clarity and ease of maintenance.

### Technologies Used

- **Vue.js** (via CDN): for state management and interactivity.
- **Plain CSS**: for responsive layout, including Flexbox, with compiled SCSS for enhanced maintainability.
- **Semantic HTML**: to support basic accessibility requirements.

### Summary

This project illustrates a solid foundation in responsive design and Vue.js within a limited time frame, meeting core functional requirements. The additional enhancements mentioned highlight my knowledge of scalable, user-centered front-end development and demonstrate how I would improve the application with additional time.
